# Loan-Prediction
A machine learning project that uses Decision Trees and Random Forest classifiers to predict whether a loan will be fully paid or not, based on borrower features. Includes model evaluation with confusion matrices and classification reports.

##  Project Objectives
- Load and preprocess loan data
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Evaluate and compare both models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Analyze results using classification reports and confusion matrices

- ##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Metrics
The model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
